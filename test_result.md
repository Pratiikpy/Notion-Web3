# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🚀 RENDER DEPLOYMENT OPTIMIZATIONS COMPLETED: 
    1. Dockerfile updated with ENV PORT=8000 and dynamic port CMD using ${PORT:-8000}
    2. Added image optimization with npm prune --production and pip cache purge
    3. CORS middleware updated to allow Render domains (placeholder YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com)
    4. Removed /build from .gitignore to allow frontend build files for deployment
    5. ✅ FIXED: Added static file serving to FastAPI - app.mount('/static') and app.mount('/') for React SPA
    6. ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Multi-stage Docker build implemented to properly build React frontend
    7. Created comprehensive README with Render deployment guide and environment variables
    8. App now respects Render's dynamic port assignment while maintaining local development compatibility
    
    MULTI-STAGE BUILD SOLUTION:
    - Stage 1: Node.js 18 builds React frontend using yarn build
    - Stage 2: Python 3.11 backend with built frontend copied to /app/static
    - COPY --from=frontend /app/frontend/build ./static ensures React build files are included
    - This fixes the white screen issue by properly building and serving the React app
    
    STATIC FILE SERVING SOLUTION:
    - Added app.mount('/static', StaticFiles(directory='static'), name='static') for JS/CSS chunks
    - Added app.mount('/', StaticFiles(directory='static', html=True), name='root') for React SPA routing
    - This fixes the 404 error by serving index.html for all unknown routes (client-side routing)
    
    NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
    - Deploy to Render with required environment variables (MONGO_URL, IRYS_PRIVATE_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, DB_NAME)
    - After deployment, replace YOUR-SERVICE in server.py with actual Render service name
    - All optimizations maintain free tier compatibility and React app will now load properly with all static assets"

    SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
    1. ✅ Updated frontend/.env to correct production URL: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://notion-web3.onrender.com
    2. ✅ Modified build process to properly load environment variables: export $(cat .env | xargs) && yarn build
    3. ✅ Verified built JavaScript contains correct backend URL: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL:'https://notion-web3.onrender.com'
    4. ✅ Copied corrected build files to backend static directory for serving

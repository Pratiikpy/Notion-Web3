The previous AI engineer meticulously investigated and attempted to resolve critical deployment issues for a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application on Render. The primary challenge was persistent  and  errors caused by a  prefix in frontend API calls to the backend. Initial diagnosis revealed a misconfigured  in the frontend's  file, which was subsequently corrected. However, the issue persisted due to Render's build process not correctly injecting environment variables into the React frontend's static JavaScript bundle. A MongoDB SSL handshake error was also identified, causing some backend functionalities to fail. The AI employed iterative debugging, local testing, and leveraged a  to pinpoint the root cause of the environment variable injection failure. The current state is that local builds correctly embed the desired backend URL, but the deployed Render site still needs validation for proper environment variable injection.

The user's primary goal is to fix a deployed full-stack application, Irys Snippet Vault API with Social Features, hosted on Render, which is currently non-functional.
The explicit issues reported by the user are:
1.  **Application Not Working on Render:** The deployed site  is not fully operational.
2.  **Profile Tab Not Opening:** A specific frontend UI element or feature is broken.
3.  **Functions Not Working:** General backend API endpoints are failing, leading to a broken user experience.
4.  **API Errors:** Logs show  and  for API calls, consistently exhibiting a  prefix (e.g., , ).
5.  **MongoDB Connectivity Issue:** An  error was observed when the backend attempted to connect to MongoDB Atlas on Render.
6.  **Claude API Error:** A  was detected, indicating an authentication or configuration problem with the AI model integration.

The desired outcome is a fully functional application on Render, where all API calls are correctly routed, MongoDB connectivity is established, and third-party integrations like Claude API function as expected.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Deployment:** Render platform.
-   **API Routing:** FastAPI  and Kubernetes Ingress rules requiring  prefix.
-   **Environment Variables:** , ,  and their injection into application bundles/runtime.
-   **React Build Process:** How React embeds environment variables at build time.
-   **Troubleshooting:** Diagnostic approach, log analysis, using a specialized .

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard three-tier architecture:


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file defines the core FastAPI application. It includes CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests, defines an  with a  prefix for all backend endpoints (e.g., , , , , , ), and serves static files for the React frontend. It's crucial for defining the backend's API contract.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Temporarily modified  to  and back to diagnose routing.
        -   Minor arbitrary edits (e.g., adding comments) to force Render redeployments.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file holds environment-specific variables for the React frontend.  is critical as it dictates the base URL for all API calls from the frontend to the backend. Other variables like  define blockchain interaction endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was explicitly set to  to point to the correct deployed backend URL.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main entry point for the React application. It contains the primary UI components, manages state, and dispatches  requests to the backend using the  environment variable. This file's API call logic is central to the frontend's interaction with the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Temporarily modified API call paths to remove  prefix during troubleshooting, then reverted.
        -   No persistent changes visible in the provided trajectory snippet, as build-time environment variable verification was shifted to .

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages project dependencies and defines scripts for development and building the React application. The  script compiles the React source code into static assets for deployment.
    -   **Changes Made**: A  script was added to explicitly check and log the  environment variable during the frontend build process. This was a diagnostic step to confirm Render's environment variable injection:
        

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains sensitive environment variables for the FastAPI backend, including  for database connection,  for AI model integration, and  for blockchain interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes were made to this file within the provided trajectory, but its contents were inspected for issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure the  is correctly injected and utilized by the frontend build on Render.
-   Address the , likely due to  not being correctly picked up by the backend on Render.
-   Confirm full MongoDB connectivity on the deployed Render environment, despite the user confirming IP whitelist.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively troubleshooting why the deployed React frontend on Render was still making API calls with a double  prefix, resulting in  errors, despite local fixes and explicit updates to  in . The root cause was identified by the  as a platform environment variable injection failure specific to Render's build process for React applications, meaning the  was not correctly embedded into the JavaScript bundle at build time on the deployed platform.

To diagnose and resolve this, the AI engineer has:
1.  **Confirmed  Update**: Verified that  correctly points to .
2.  **Added Build-Time Environment Variable Check**: Modified  by adding a  script:
    
    This script is designed to print the value of  during the yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. process, providing visibility into what Render's build environment sees.
3.  **Local Build Verification**: Successfully ran yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. locally multiple times, confirming that the  script correctly echoed the  and that the *built* JavaScript files () locally contained the correct backend URL: . This proves the local setup and build process are correct.

The nuance is that while the local build correctly embeds the variable, the issue persists *on Render*, implying that Render's environment variable handling during the build process is the culprit. The engineer has provided detailed instructions to the user to manually trigger redeploys on Render, emphasizing that a fresh build is required for the React app to pick up the updated environment variables. The last action was to prepare for testing backend accessibility *from the deployed frontend* to continue isolating the issue.

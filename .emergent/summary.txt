The AI engineer successfully developed the Irys Snippet Vault from a product brief, moving from a demo version to a fully functional Web3 application. The initial focus was on establishing core integrations, particularly Irys blockchain and Claude AI. Significant effort was dedicated to resolving frontend build issues related to Webpack polyfills and Irys SDK compatibility. A crucial architectural decision was the introduction of a Node.js  backend component to handle Irys SDK calls, abstracting this from the Python FastAPI server. The application now supports real Irys devnet/mainnet storage, AI summarization, and wallet integration. The most recent work involves adding social and collaboration features as requested by the user, starting with backend endpoints for following/unfollowing and liking/unliking snippets.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Notion-themed web app, Irys Snippet Vault, with the following core functionalities:
1.  **Wallet Connection:** Via MetaMask (Ethers.js).
2.  **URL Clipping:** Input URL, fetch title and selected text snippet.
3.  **AI Summarization & Tagging:** Auto-summarize into a 1-sentence summary and 3 topical tags using Claude (initially GPT, but changed to Claude by user).
4.  **Permanent Storage on Irys:** Package  as JSON and upload via Irys SDK.
5.  **Snippet Listing:** Query Irys for user's entries and display in a Notion-style card grid.
6.  **Snippet Details:** On click, view full text, metadata, and link to gateway JSON.

Additional requirements/refinements:
*   **Production-grade & Deployable:** Vercel compatibility.
*   **Design System:** Official Irys design (cyans, purples, glassmorphism, JetBrains Mono + Inter fonts).
*   **Network Toggle:** Option to switch between Irys devnet and mainnet.
*   **Custom Cursor:** A specific anime cat sticker for the mouse cursor.
*   **Social & Collaboration Features (Latest Request):** Public snippet feed, trending content, follow other users, like/bookmark system, comment system.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** Next.js (React 18, TypeScript) for frontend, FastAPI (Python) for backend.
-   **Web3 Integration:** Ethers.js v6 for MetaMask wallet interaction,  and  for Irys blockchain storage and retrieval.
-   **AI Integration:** Claude API for text summarization and tag generation.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom UI components (shadcn/ui, GlassCard, NeonButton) and Irys design system.
-   **Serverless Functions:** FastAPI endpoints for AI processing and URL content extraction.
-   **Persistent Storage:** Irys blockchain for permanent snippet storage; MongoDB for temporary/demo storage initially (later removed for Irys).
-   **Module Bundling:** Webpack polyfills (via Craco/Vite config) for Node.js modules in browser environment.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, designed for Vercel deployment.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The core FastAPI backend application. It exposes API endpoints for URL snippet extraction, AI summarization, and, crucially, acts as an intermediary for Irys blockchain operations by calling the  script. It also handles social features like following/unfollowing and liking/unliking.
    -   **Changes:** Initially included mock data storage. Updated to integrate with  for real Irys uploads/queries. Modified to fix MongoDB ObjectID serialization errors. Most recently, social endpoints for , , ,  were added.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** A newly introduced Node.js script. This service acts as a dedicated Irys integration layer for the Python backend. It handles all Irys SDK (JavaScript) interactions, including wallet funding, uploading, and querying, exposing them as HTTP endpoints for the FastAPI server. This was a key architectural decision to bridge Python backend with Node.js-based Irys SDK.
    -   **Changes:** Created as a new file.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The main React component rendering the application's UI. It manages state (wallet connection, snippet data, loading), orchestrates API calls to the backend (for snippet fetching, summarization), and interacts with the Irys blockchain via helper functions.
    -   **Changes:** Initial setup for Notion-themed UI, wallet connection, and mock Irys interaction. Transitioned to real Irys integration, including handling real transaction IDs and gateway links. Updated to display accurate Irys network information (devnet/mainnet, cost).

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS directives, defining the application's visual theme including Irys-specific colors, glassmorphism, and typography.
    -   **Changes:** Incorporated Irys design system. Updated for custom cursor styles (initially through , then merged/handled within ), including fallbacks for missing images. Added styles for network information display.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Houses utility functions for interacting with the Irys SDK from the frontend. This includes  for initializing the uploader,  for sending data, and  for retrieving data based on user wallet and tags.
    -   **Changes:** Adapted from the initial prompt's  snippet. Modified for  and . Updated  to correctly use  search syntax for real blockchain querying.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The UI component responsible for the snippet clipping and saving workflow. It handles URL input, fetching content (via backend API), calling the summarization API, and triggering the Irys upload.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented the core logic for snippet handling, including calls to the backend's  and  endpoints. Integrated the  function from .

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Configuration file for Create React App (CRACO) to customize Webpack behavior. It's crucial for adding polyfills required by certain Web3 libraries (like Irys SDK) that rely on Node.js core modules (e.g., , ) in a browser environment.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to include webpack  for Node.js modules to their browser-compatible polyfills, specifically for , , etc., to resolve build errors encountered with Irys SDK.

-   ** (and related image paths in CSS):**
    -   **Summary:** A separate CSS file (or styles directly integrated into ) for custom mouse cursors based on user interaction. It defines different cursor images for default, pointer, text, and loading states.
    -   **Changes:** Created to implement custom cursor functionality. Subsequent changes focused on fixing build errors by referencing placeholder/default cursors and providing instructions for the user to add actual image files.

-   ** and **:
    -   **Summary:** Markdown files documenting the custom cursor implementation and providing instructions to the user on how to add their desired cursor image files to the  directory for the custom cursors to appear.
    -   **Changes:** Created as new documentation files.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Implementation for Social Features:**
    -   Public snippet feed with trending content.
    -   User profiles to follow others and view their snippets.
    -   Like/bookmark system for snippets.
    -   Comment system on snippets (stored as linked data).
-   **Adding Custom Cursor Images:** The user still needs to provide the actual image files (, , , ) to  for the custom cursor functionality to visually appear.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the **Social & Collaboration Features** as explicitly requested by the user. The focus was on setting up the backend infrastructure for these features.

Specifically, the AI engineer completed the backend implementation for:
1.  **Following/Unfollowing Users:** API endpoints and logic to allow users to follow and unfollow each other.
2.  **Liking/Unliking Snippets:** API endpoints and logic for users to like and unlike snippets.

The last visible action (Chat Message 266-267) shows that the backend changes for , , , and  routes in  have been applied. The AI engineer is now proceeding to implement the frontend social features, which would involve integrating these new backend endpoints into the React UI to display public feeds, user profiles, and interactive like/follow buttons.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue implementing the frontend UI for the social and collaboration features, integrating the recently added backend endpoints for following, unfollowing, liking, and unliking snippets.
